📊 Power BI Project

An interactive Power BI project focused on data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design using Maven Market data. The dashboard simulates real-world business reporting with multi-page navigation and actionable insights.

Key Highlights include:

⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query- Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new calculated columns

🔗 Data Modeling- Built relationships across multiple tables including customers, products, stores, and sale returns

🧮 DAX Measures- Created custom measures to calculate revenue, profit margin, refund rate, and other key KPIs

📊 Dynamic Visuals- Used slicers, bar charts, and cards to build insightful and visually clean dashboards

🖱️ Interactive Reporting- Used slicers to dynamically filter data across pages and buttons for seamless page navigation and custom tooltips


**Note: The data was sourced from a community-contributed dataset on Kaggle and modified for analysis.**
